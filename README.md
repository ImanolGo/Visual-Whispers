# 🎨 Visual Whispers

An experimental AI art project that plays "Chinese Whispers" (also known as "Telephone") with images. The twist? The AI describes each image through different personas or perspectives, creating an imaginative chain of visual interpretations.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project is a learning experiment combining different AI models to explore:
- Image generation with Stable Diffusion models
- Image-to-text capabilities with configurable perspectives
- How different viewpoints affect the evolution of generated images
- API integrations and prompt engineering
- The creative "drift" of images through multiple AI interpretations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Backend: Python/FastAPI
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
- AI Models (via Replicate API):
  - Image Generation: stability-ai/sdxl
  - Image Description: salesforce/blip

## 📋 Prerequisites

[Installation section remains the same...]

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Initial Setup:
   - Enter your initial prompt (e.g., "a serene lake at sunset")
   - Choose a perspective for image description (e.g., "as a medieval peasant")
   - Set the "imagination level" (0.0 - 1.0)

2. Generation Process:
   - Click "Generate First Image" to start
   - The AI will:
     1. Generate an image from your prompt
     2. Describe that image from your chosen perspective
     3. Use that description to generate the next image
   - Click "Next Iteration" when ready to continue
   - You can change the perspective or imagination level at any point

3. Controls:
   - Manual iteration control with "Next Iteration" button
   - Perspective selector for image description
   - Imagination level slider (temperature)
   - Reset button to start a new chain

## 🌟 Features

- Customizable perspectives for image description:
  - Historical figures (e.g., "as a medieval peasant", "as a Victorian explorer")
  - Age-based perspectives (e.g., "as a 6-year-old child", "as a wise elder")
  - Professional viewpoints (e.g., "as an art critic", "as a botanist")
  - Cultural perspectives (e.g., "as a Buddhist monk", "as a Renaissance artist")
- Adjustable "imagination level" (temperature):
  - Low (0.0-0.3): Literal, detailed descriptions
  - Medium (0.4-0.7): Balanced interpretation
  - High (0.8-1.0): More creative and imaginative descriptions
- Visual history showing the evolution of images
- Display of:
  - Original prompt
  - Current perspective/persona
  - AI-generated description
  - Imagination level
- Download capability for image sequences
- Shareable links for interesting chains

## 💡 Tips

- Experiment with different perspectives:
  - Try contrasting viewpoints (e.g., "modern scientist" vs "ancient shaman")
  - Use emotional perspectives (e.g., "as an optimistic poet")
  - Mix technical and naive viewpoints
- Imagination level effects:
  - Lower values (0.1-0.3) for more consistent image chains
  - Higher values (0.7-1.0) for more surprising and creative evolution
  - Mid-range (0.4-0.6) for balanced interpretation
- Start with clear, distinctive images for best results
- Try running the same initial image through different perspectives

## ⚙️ Advanced Usage

- Combine perspectives with time periods (e.g., "as a 1920s jazz musician")
- Use professional perspectives for specific details (e.g., "as a botanist focusing on plant species")
- Experiment with emotional states (e.g., "as an excited child on Christmas morning")
- Try abstract perspectives (e.g., "as a color-blind painter", "as a time traveler")

## 📝 Notes

- This is an experimental project for learning purposes
- Description generation may take longer with more complex perspectives
- The quality of the image chain depends on both the clarity of the perspective and the imagination level
- The Replicate API has usage limits - check their documentation for details
